## Threat-Analysis-Suite
An opensource threat analysis suite for NGO's, Humanitarian Efforts, and basic INT Analysis.

### Main User Stories
* As a user, I may not have the internet and will require an offline capable suite.
* As a user, I would like to be able to view geospatial global threat data; and from that data derive basic intelligence.
* As a user, I don't plan to host this suite, and may be running this off an Raspberry Pi or any light architexture so it needs to be light weight but reliable.
* As a user, I want to add my own data to the suite.

### Side Lines
There won't be a need for session management, or user logins.
There won't be a need to add complicated security.
